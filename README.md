This project was built with Create React App.


It is a minimum viable product of an event tracker web app in the same vein as MeetUp. Built with React.js, it uses several libraries including Redux, Semantic-UI for styling, react-router, and Google-Map-React to wrap the google maps API. The stored data lives on Google Firebase. When I have more time there will be future improvements made in the way of implementing a user profile and being able to customize a users personal data. I plan to eventually include a more social network like experience where one user can follow another, as well as implement a chat system. At this point the app is more a proof of concept than anything else.

The app consumes an API provided by the City of Helsinki. Each point represents a cultural landmark that also serves as an area where events are often held. More information about the API can be found here: https://dev.hel.fi/apis/linked-events/   

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me. Thanks
